Installation:

Install LAMP stack

Install MongoDB, php5, mongo-php
add Mongo to php.ini
Add user "technicolor," pw "testbed" to Mongo

mongoimport --db backendtest --collection user --file usercollection.json

Note: 

The security here is set to be easy to test, with plaintext values for username and passwords. In production, hash and salts would be used to store and check username and password values. Also, the login cookie would corespond to a login entry on the MongoDB
